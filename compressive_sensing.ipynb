    "In signal processing we are often interested in reconstructing a signal $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ given some observation data $y \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$. By assuming linear measurements we can state the linear system of equations $Ax = y$. Here, the matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times N}$ denotes the measurement process and is often referred to as the measurement matrix. Solving this linear system depends on the dimensions of $A$. If the number of measurements $m$ is at least as large as the signal length $N$ we can solve the well-defined system of equations. However, if we consider the case that $m<N$, i.e. $A$ is a wide matrix, we get an underdetermined linear system. Due to the ill-posedness of the underdetermined system $Ax=y$, the original problem becomes an infinite dimensional problem with infinitely many solutions. Compressive Sensing (CS) introduces certain assumptions on the signal $x$ and provides the theory to recover $x$ when the system $Ax=y$ is underdetermined. The underlying assumption is sparsity, restricting solutions to vectors that have few nonzero entries.\n",

    "A vector is $s$-sparse if it has at most $s$ nonzero elements. Using the notion of the $\\mathcal{l}_0$-norm denoted by $||x||_0$, we count the number of nonzero elements of the vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$. As it turns out, many real-world signals become sparse when properly transformed - this is the case in image compression. In the following code cell we compress an image by applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and reconstruct the image with a small amount of wavelet coefficients. For the reconstruction we used only the strongest wavelet coefficients as all other coefficients were set to zero. "
